The work depends on the client and the problem you’re helping them solve.

"74901037","2025 KPMG Vacationer Program – Risk","GradConnection","Full time","Security ","Why choose Risk as a vacationer?  Balancing risk and reward is a fine art. It’s not just about identifying risks, but also innovative solutions. It’s being compliant but also competitive. Vacationer roles in risk are an opportunity to help organisations plan for and tackle what’s around the next corner, and the one after that too. You could be digging into model data to predict event likelihood, identifying measures to keep vulnerable people safe, or investigating opportunities to maximise investments in governance technology. Choose your pathway Everyone’s career is different, and we support unique growth and pathways. With a range of disciplines and specialities, you can start in one place and go almost anywhere as you build your career here. Apply to this Business, Consulting and Risk pathway and you’ll have the option to select up to three preferences for the stream of work you’re interested in. Not sure or open to something new? No preference means we’ll match you where your degree and interests fit. Location of this job: nominate your KPMG office location during the application process. What is being a consultant? You’ll be part of a team of experienced and early-career professionals who work on solving problems. The client (they could be an international company, a local charity, a small business) brings us a challenge and we create a team and a plan to help solve it. That team will be made up of colleagues from several disciplines and backgrounds so we bring the best ideas to the table – there might be forensic accountants working alongside a supply chain specialist and human rights experts. The work depends on the client and the problem you’re helping them solve. You might be researching and gathering information, like how have we helped another client with a similar challenge and how new technologies could help, updating project plans, as well as the delivery of the solution your client selects.

Perhaps you have it all in the cloud to avoid the space and cost of running it at home. I'd love to hear about it. Ideally we're looking for someone with 1 - 4 years of IT experience, preferably in an MSP but we'll consider anyone who can prove they have the skills, even if they've learnt them at home. Belmont based MSP. No two days are the same. Sometimes onsite, sometimes in the office. Always challenging and fun.  Doing reactive support tickets is probably only 30%- 40% of your day. The rest is proactive work, projects, your own certification study or passion projects. Training opportunities, time to study at work, immediate salary increase after obtaining ceritification. Regular social activities. Friendly culture. Follow your passion - time to work on passion projects and upskill If you want to do more than basic level 1 tickets and grow under highly technical engineers, then consider this one.

This company culture is : Process driven, mature documentation, professional Staff are looked after and cared for in a team environment They are a technically saavy team, where you'll learn fast They call a spade a spade, you'll always know where you stand The work is varied and challenging and employees are supported to grow their skills. The day to day support work is based mainly from their office in Belmont or onsite when you visit their clients. They're an MSP that look after small and medium sized businesses. So the work is fun and challenging and you'll learn a lot in a short amount of time. There will be some site work and projects to be involved with as well. So you'll get face time with clients, you will get out of the office and you will be expected to be professional in manner and presentation. They even have their own data center hosting services, so you'll get your hands on some really cool tech.  The fun tech stuff, that you'll be using – Strong networking focus - troubleshoot DNS, DHCP, vlans, vpn problems. VOIP phone system knowledge - preferably 3CX but other vendor experience including Asterisk types are good. Windows Desktops in AD environments Windows Server typical versions 2016 - 2022  Exchange  online , M365 - admin/support Active Directory, GP Hyper V, Terminal Server (basic understanding) If you know how to configure simple fortinet or fortigate devices, that's a plus. My client wants MSP experience with small business tech, however if you don't have that but can prove you have some really good networking skills or even linux exposure in a home lab environment, then apply anyway. If you've got the tech credentials and a year or two's IT experience anywhere then I'll go into bat for you with my client. Some people call the below soft skills - I don't know why. We need these though: A warm yet professional phone manner with a genuine customer service focus. Outstanding interpersonal skills - be good with people. Like them a whole lot. Ability to work in a team... and get on well with everyone. But speak up - don't just be a yes man. Be rigorous in managing daily tasks. Attention to detail and following checklists is a must A sense of humour, don't take yourself too seriously A willingness to learn - probably the most important part. You can be taught what you don't know. Contribute high quality documentation. (Yes, sorry - I know you're a techie but it's part of the job). MSP experience and knowledge in MSP tools So challenge me - hit me with your resumes people.. prove to me you have what it takes.
